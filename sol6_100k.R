# SIX-CARD KLONDIKE SOLITAIRE     Jeff Gauthier     v0.1.0          2025-08-07
#===============================================================================
# 
# A toy 6-card Klondike implementation in R to learn how to make a solver 
# and study solitaire probabilities.
# 
# This main script computes 100,000 random 6-card solitaire games and
# finds the best solutions by brute-force for each unique winnable draw.
# 
# Everything here is coded in base R, except for a dependency (Rmisc) for
# reporting sample bias at the end (optional, code is commented).
#
#===============================================================================
#
# LAYOUT OF THE GAME
# - Six cards (1,2,3,4,5,6)
# - No suits
# - Two columns (first = two cards, 2nd = two cards)
# - One foundation pile
# - One stock pile
#
# DEALING CARDS
#     - Cards are dealt from index 1 to 6
#     - One card in column 1
#     - Two cards in column 2
#     - then the rest goes in the stock pile.
#     - All cards are visible
#
# GAME RULES
#     - The last card (highest index) in each column or pile
#         is the face-up card.
#     - One card can be moved at at time (no sequence moves)
#     - Drawing a card = putting the face-up card at the bottom
#         (shifting an array to the right)
#
# # Example structure before dealing:
# myGame <- list(
#   cards = c(1,2,3,4,5,6),
#   pile = numeric(0),
#   col1 = numeric(0),
#   col2 = numeric(0)
# )
#
# # Example after a random dealing:
# myGame <- list(
#   cards = c(3,1,5),
#   pile = numeric(0),
#   col1 = 4,
#   col2 = c(2,6)
# )

# BONUS: Draw coverage homogeneity
#===============================================================================
# There are 6! = 720 ways to shuffle 6 cards from 1 to 6.
# Here I checked how many unique draws were dealt (should be 720) since
# 100,000 games were played. Then I checked if unique draws were equally 
# sampled (100,000 / 720 = 138.89 ~ 139).
#
# So each unique draw should have been played ~139 times.
# There were 720 unique draws (6!). So all possible games have
# been played at least once.
# 
# Each draw has been played 139 Â± 12 times in average.
# 
# Given that:
# - Sample 95% CI = [138, 140] (N = 100,000)
# - Expected value : 100000/720 = 138.8889 ~ 139
# I concluded that draws are equally represented, and that each unique
# draw had an equal chance of having a best solution found.
